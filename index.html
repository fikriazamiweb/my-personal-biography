<center><h4 style="color: maroon">Strenght and Weakness</h4></center>

<p>Strengths and weaknesses generally refer to a person's character. Often a strength can be a weakness, and vice versa, a weakness can be a strength. In Chinese philosophy, yin and yang are described as complementary opposites within a greater whole.</p>

<ol>
	<li style="color: navy"><i>Strenght</i>- Persistence</li>
	<p>I’m thorough and tenacious. When I’m on a project, I keep track of the details. Because I have a comprehensive understanding of the components, I can spot the essentials and rigorously advocate for them to meet deadlines. I regularly see this reflected in my peer and management feedback.</p>
	<li style="color: navy"><i>Weakness</i>- Difficulty Asking Questions</li>
	<p>I default to believing that I can solve any problem on my own. This works well in some situations, but in many cases, I need the help of others to overcome factors beyond my control.</p>
</ol>
